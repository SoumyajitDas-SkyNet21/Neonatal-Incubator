# Neonatal-Incubator

## Final Year Project ||  Electronics and Communication Department || College - MCKV Institute of Engineering

Infant incubators maintain a healthy environment for newborn babies. They are used for premature babies which are still small and weak as well as for some sick full-term babies.Incubators are used in the primary care department of a hospital or in the neonatal intensive care unit. 

### Purpose 

The incubator consists of a transparent cabinet in which the baby is kept in a neutral environment for medical care. Neutral means, that the surrounding air has the optimal temperature and moisture and the baby only needs minimum of energy to maintain normal body temperature. 

The infant incubator :
  * controls the temperature 
  * controls the humidity 
  * can deliver additional oxygen 
  * protects against infections and diseases
  * protects against noise 
  
In order maintain the body temperature of the baby (36 - 37.2°C) the incubator must be able to create an ambient air of 34 - 38°C with a humidity of 40 - 80%.
