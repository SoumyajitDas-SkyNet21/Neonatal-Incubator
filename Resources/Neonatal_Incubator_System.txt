						Neonatal Incubator System(NICU)

General overview :
 # Provide optimal conditions for development and
 protection for neonates.

Functions of an Incubator :
 . Safe & Controlled enviromental conditions,i.e
   Tempertature(air),Humidity, Oxygen,etc.

 . Monitoring of vital organs and measure parameters
   such as temperature,heart rate, sp02 levels,
   breathing rate etc. 

 . Maintains a hygenic space and act as a shield 
   against germs and infections.

  


Scenarios for requirements-:
	. Premature Births (preterm infants)
	. Breathing Issues
	. Infection
	. Low birth weight
  . Recovering from surgery

Why temperature needs to be controlled ?
# Hypothermia : Neonates can't regulate their own 
								 body temp.
#Need to maintain a const. temperature. 
 

                     NICU Types

. Open Air(Radiant Warmer)     . Closed Box(Our Target)

Motivation / Inspiration : Low-cost   

Physical Design Parameters: 

. Favourably closed loop/box environment(Canopy).
			. Glass/Plastic(HQ) covered rectangular shape.
			. Access ports(IRIS) for human interactions.
			. Minimum heat loss.
. Transparent .
. Minimum exposure to light and sound.
. High quality insulation to reduce risk for infants.  
. Portable.

Electronic/Electric Design parameters :

. Panels/Screen to show real-time parameters 
. Buttons(touch) for adjusting  
								. Air temp. 
								. Humidity level.
								. Oxygen level.
.Alarm for :
         .Overheating 
		 .Low humidity concentration.
		 .Failed thermoregulation.
		 .Lower spo2 levels,heart rate.
		 
.Single power outlet(220 V AC).


Why we need to control humidity ?
# Right amount of humidity protects infants skin
  from losing too much water, developing crack and 
  becoming brittles.
Ideal Skin Temperature :

	Skin Low  -: 36.5 *C
	Skin High -: 37.5 *C
	
Ideal Humidity level :
	Low: 75%
	High:86%

 If skin-temp<36.5 & skin-temp >37.5 for 30-minutes
  
       then Failed Thermoregulation
   
 
Closed Box Incubator System : 
 
  . We have to make a fresh air filtration system. 
  
  
  
Major Components(Primary) for Incubator System : 
. Heater.
. Humidifier.
. Front Panel.
. Filter : Protects infants from airborne bacteria and germs.
. Blower : Circulate air inside the canopy.
. Power Supply.

Sensors for Monitoring Organ Statistics  :

. Pulse-oximeter         :  sp02 concentration/level.
. Heart rate             :  To track heart rate.
. Skin temperature probe :  To measure infants skin temperature.

Blowing Mechanism :

 A high-speed fan will act as a main blower. This blower will intake air from the 
 environment passing through a filter.
 
Heating Mechanism:
 
  The air from the blower will directly pass over the heating element.By conduction,
  the air will absorb heat and will be directed towards the entering channel.
